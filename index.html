    <h1>Improvisation workshops for teams and groups</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Presence, listening, and relationships in complex contexts</p>

    <p>
      I work with groups of people – in corporate settings and wellbeing contexts – using
      theatrical improvisation as a tool for exploration, training, and transformation.

      If you are looking for a workshop that combines competence, depth, and empathy,
      you are in the right place.

    <h2>What I do</h2>

    <h3>Workshops for companies and teams</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Communication and active listening</li>
      <li>Collaboration and trust</li>
      <li>Leadership and status dynamics</li>
      <li>Dealing with uncertainty and change</li>
      <li>Presence and clarity in interactions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Improvisation makes visible the dynamics that often remain implicit in working
      environments, creating a concrete space to observe, understand, and transform them.
    </p>

    <h3>Workshops for groups and wellbeing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Relational awareness</li>
      <li>Trust and group connection</li>
      <li>Presence and body awareness</li>
      <li>Exploring relationships with others and with the unexpected</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The work is experiential, accessible, and respectful of each participant’s pace and boundaries.
    </p>

    <h2>My approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experience before theory</strong>: learning happens through doing, observing, and reflecting together</li>
      <li><strong>Structure and safety</strong>: play only works within clear and shared boundaries</li>
      <li><strong>Listening and relationship</strong>: attention is always on what happens between people</li>
      <li><strong>No performance required</strong>: there is no need to “act” or perform</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Improvisation is not used as entertainment, but as a tool for inquiry and growth.

    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>
      I am a trainer and teacher of theatrical improvisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years I have worked with a wide variety of groups: corporate teams, artists,
      students, and people with no previous theatre experience. This has allowed me to develop
      a solid, flexible, and deeply human approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      I collaborate with an international network of professionals and training organisations,
      integrating artistic, pedagogical, and organisational expertise.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is not to teach techniques, but to create the conditions for a group to function better.
